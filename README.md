# Oneiroi

Oneiroi is a multi-functional, self-contained experimental digital synth focused on ambient pads and drone-like landscapes.
It features a full stereo signal path, 3 oscillators (2 of them are mutually exclusive), 4 effects and a looper. It also includes self-modulation and a randomizer.

Oneiroi has been developed by Roberto Noris (<https://github.com/hirnlego>) and is based on Rebel Technologyâ€™s OWL platform.

## Updating The patch via browser (Plain human way)

Open a Web-MIDI-enabled browser. We recommend using Chrome or Chromium.
Other Browsers would maybe work but it has not been tested.

Find the latest patch from the release page:

<https://github.com/Befaco/Oneiroi/tags>

Click on "Downloads" and download the file named "patch.syx"

Connect Oneiroi to a standard Eurorack power supply and your computer using any USBs on the bottom.

On your browser, go to the OpenWare Laboratory:

<https://pingdynasty.github.io/OwlWebControl/extended.html>

Check if Oneiroi is connected to the page: The page should say: "Connected to Oneiroi vx.x.x"

Click "Choose file" and upload the patch.syx from your computer

Push "Store". A popup will appear, asking for the slot. Accept to store on slot 1.

Done!



## Building and flashing the patch (Nerdy way)

To build and flash the patch you can either run

`make PLATFORM=OWL3 PATCHNAME=Oneiroi CONFIG=Release clean load`

to load it in RAM (temporarily), or

`make PLATFORM=OWL3 PATCHNAME=Oneiroi CONFIG=Release clean store SLOT=1`

to store it in FLASH (permanently), or

`make PLATFORM=OWL3 PATCHNAME=Oneiroi CONFIG=Release clean sysex`

to generate `./Build/patch.syx` that can be flashed with
the online tool

## Calibration Procedure 

It calibrates V/OCT IN, and manual Controls range.

Updating the patch do not erase the calibration data, so no need to perform calibration after patch update.

Only needed after module's assembly (usually preformed only at factory or by DIYers).


  1- Power the module while holding [MOD AMT + SHIFT] buttons at the same time. 
The [RECORD] button should light up red indicating you are in Calibration Mode.


  2- Place both the PITCH knob and the VARISPEED knob in the middle, this allows for calibrating the center point
  
  3- Plug 2 Volts into V/OCT IN and push [RECORD] button. Now [SHIFT] button will light up red.

  4- Plug 5 Volts into V/OCT IN and push [SHIFT] button. Now [RANDOM] button will light up red.

  5- Plug 8 Volts into V/OCT IN and push [RANDOM] button. Now [MOD AMT] button will light up green. 

  6- Move all manual controls to the minimum position, this is all pots counter-clockwise and all faders down.
  
  7- Move all manual controls to the maximun position, this is all pots clockwise and all faders up.

  7- Push [MOD AMT] button to exit calibration mode.
