# Changelog

## 1.2.2 (2025-10-03)

- fixed unwanted resonator harmonics (https://github.com/Befaco/Oneiroi/issues/38)

## 1.2.1 (2025-09-22)

- fixed looper's start and length knobs not working when speed = 0 (https://github.com/Befaco/Oneiroi/issues/50)

  https://www.rebeltech.org/patch-library/device/)

## 1.2.0 (2025-05-12)

- fixed 0v-1v V/Oct CV range (needs hw fix) (<https://github.com/Befaco/Oneiroi/issues/37>)

- removed V/Oct CV attenuation feature
- not using calibration data for knobs and faders anymore

## 1.1.1 (2024-12-14)

- Changed BP filter from biguad to SVF to prevent potential instabilities (from
  VCV version, see https://github.com/Befaco/Oneiroi/commit/4bf7fddd1839bae72684bd95c76c348c0f2ba5d1)
